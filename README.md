# Voting-Machine-Verilog  
This repository contains verilog code for designing a Voting Machine.  
Created 4 modules and a testbench file  

Module for checking button is pressed accurately or not: ButtonControl  

Module for increasing the vote count after being voted for each candidate: VoteLogger  

Module for checking whether the user want to cast the vote or check the vote count of particular candidate: ModeControl 

Top Module for controlling all the modules: Voting Machine  

Simulated the logic via the Testbench file in Modelsim and Generated the Netlists for all models. Added the same in this repository.
